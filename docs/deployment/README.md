# TaskManager Deployment Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive deployment guides for deploying the TaskManager application to various cloud providers.

## Available Deployment Guides

- [Microsoft Azure](azure.md) - Deploy TaskManager using Azure App Service, Container Registry, and other Azure services
- [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](aws.md) - Deploy TaskManager using AWS Elastic Beanstalk, ECS, RDS, and other AWS services
- [DigitalOcean](digitalocean.md) - Deploy TaskManager using DigitalOcean App Platform and managed databases

## Common DevOps Best Practices

All deployment guides follow these DevOps best practices:

1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** - All infrastructure configurations are defined in code
2. **CI/CD Pipelines** - Automated build, test, and deployment processes
3. **Container-Based Deployments** - Using Docker for consistent environments
4. **Environment Variables** - Secure management of configuration and secrets
5. **Monitoring and Alerting** - Setting up proper application monitoring
6. **Auto-Scaling** - Configuring applications to scale based on demand
7. **Database Management** - Using managed database services where appropriate
8. **Security Best Practices** - Following security guidelines for each cloud provider

## Getting Started

1. Choose the cloud provider that best fits your needs
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the corresponding guide
3. Adapt the configurations as needed for your specific requirements

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of cloud services and DevOps concepts
- Command-line interface (CLI) tools for your chosen cloud provider
- Git for version control
- Docker for container-based deployments

## Additional Resources

For more information on DevOps best practices and cloud deployments, refer to the official documentation of each cloud provider.

## Continuous Integration & Deployment with CircleCI

TaskManager uses [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) for automated testing and deployment to AWS, Azure, and DigitalOcean. The pipeline includes:

- Automated testing, linting, and security scanning (Bandit for Python, Trivy for Docker)
- Secure management of secrets using CircleCI environment variables and contexts
- Deployment jobs for each supported cloud provider
- Enforcement of DevOps and security best practices

**For detailed CI/CD configuration and security guidelines, see [`../.circleci/README.md`](../../.circleci/README.md).**
